### Summary of Research:
Retinal blood vessel segmentation is an important topic of research as it is directly related with the diagnosis and treatment of various serious diseases. Although a lot of progress has been made in this direction, segmentation of the retinal blood vessels still remains a challenge. This is due to various factors such as improper illumination, low contrast between blood vessels and the background, varying tortuosity and diameters of blood vessels and presence of various pathological features such as lesions, microaneurysms, and exudates, etc. that may produce unwanted artifacts during segmentation. In this work, a novel supervised blood vessel segmentation technique to extract blood vessels from a retinal image has been proposed.

Changes in the blood vascular structure are the first indication thata person is affected by some disease.  Various diseases are diagnosed by thestructure of retinal blood vessels.  Manual extraction is challenging; therefore,the automation of this process is significant.  In the review, various supervised blood  vessel  segmentation  techniques  along  with  classifiers  and  frameworkshave been reviewed besides performance measures employed, benefits and lim-itations.  Proposed techniques are measured on the DRIVE, CHASE and STAREdatasets.   The primary intent of this study is to present a latest reference ofinformation on the state-of-the-art methods on blood vessel segmentation algo-rithms using deep learning so that suitable methods can be chosen according to the task.

### CONCLUSION 
A comprehensive analysis of various deep learning-based retinal blood vesselsegmentation techniques has been provided in this paper.  All the frameworksthat have been used along with the number of patches, patch sizes, number ofepochs for which the models have been trained are discussed in detail alongwith the advantages and limitations of each and every technique so as to pro-vide the reader a ready reference to various novel ideas.  The results of varioustechniques have been summarized, and different datasets and metrics have alsobeen discussed in detail.  Talking about the future scope of the retinal vesselsegmentation, performance is the key factor for any technology. This research is focused mainly on enhancing the performance of retinal vessel segmentationprocess i.e. increase the accuracy of our segmentation process and decrease thecomputational load and power needed to compute the required results.
